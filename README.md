# Silver Simple Terminal
This is my customized clone of [suckless.org](https://suckless.org)'s simple terminal implementation for Xorg.
This version of st is patched with alpha, clipboard, hidecursor, keyboardselect, and
scrollback and uses my preferred color scheme. Must be running something like
compton in order to enable transparency.

## Installation

	makepkg -sri

## Uninstalling

	sudo pacman -R silver-st
